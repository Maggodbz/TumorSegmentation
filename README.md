# Brain Tumor Segmentation

This project implements a deep learning-based approach for brain tumor segmentation using medical imaging data. The implementation uses a U-Net architecture, a popular convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-segmentation-test.git
cd brain-tumor-segmentation-test
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

The main implementation is contained in the Jupyter notebook `brain-tumor-segmentation.ipynb`. The notebook includes:

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- U-Net model architecture implementation
- Training pipeline
- Evaluation metrics
- Visualization tools

To run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook brain-tumor-segmentation.ipynb
```

## Model Architecture

The project uses a U-Net architecture, which consists of:
- Encoder path (contracting)
- Decoder path (expanding)
- Skip connections between corresponding encoder and decoder levels

## Data

The model is trained on brain MRI scans. Make sure to:
1. Place your dataset in the appropriate directory
2. Update the data paths in the notebook
3. Configure the Kaggle API credentials if downloading from Kaggle

## Results

The model provides segmentation masks for brain tumors in MRI scans, with evaluation metrics including:
- Dice coefficient
- IoU (Intersection over Union)
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
